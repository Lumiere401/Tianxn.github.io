# About me 

Hello and welcome to my corner of the internet! I'm Xuening, pronounced as Schuening and I'm delighted to have you here. Let me share a bit about myself.

### Who Am I?

I'm currently a second-year master's student with a deep passion for XR and Computer Vision in Sweden. I've always been fascinated by digital technology in which things can be visualized, and I love playing billiards and board games in my free time. The ultimate goal of my research is to break the boundary between the reality and virtual world through AI or different edge-cutting technologies. Like how it shows in Ready Player One.

### My Journey

After living in my hometown, Harbin, a mega-city located in the northeast of China, for 18 years and completing my high school education, I went to start my bachelor's at Chongqing University of Posts and Telecommunication. It was during that time that I was greatly interested in Computer Vision.<br>

After graduating with honors and having my first internship in 2021, I started my first master's studies at Kunming University of Science and Technology. Also during this period, I started my research on Pedestrian Re-identification (ReID). For me, exploring unknown areas is really an enjoyable work. <br>

However, things don't always go smoothly. When I doing my first master I was always doubtful for myself that I'd only learned the theory but I hadn't had much chance to apply it to real projects. So then, I found this incredible program at Lund University and that's what made me who I am now.<br>

### What I am doing right now?
